tra.cm PHP Library

This library provides an API wrapper for the tra.cm branded domain URL shortener platform in PHP. If your company needs to shorten links automatically, you can install this library and integrate it into your software to do so. By using tra.cm to shorten links, you can avoid having to develop your own branded URL shortener software and all of the complexities that come with it such as reporting and analytics.
